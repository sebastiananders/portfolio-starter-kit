# OpenAI Operator

Today OpenAI has announced the start of Operator. Which is now in open research phase and gathers feedback from Pro users in the US.

Operator is an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you. Using its own browser, it can look at a webpage and interact with it by typing, clicking, and scrolling. **It is currently a research preview**, meaning it has limitations and will evolve based on user feedback. Operator is one of our first agents, which are AIs capable of doing work for you independently—you give it a task and it will execute it.

Agents are the new shit. Well.. acutally not - but it’s getting real this time. While some well funded start-ups get pulverized over night by introducing new features, OpenAI becomes more a too big to fail platform. AI promised to democratize the use of the web. Now we making the same mistakes we did when Facebook got big. Platform dependency is still not cool.
