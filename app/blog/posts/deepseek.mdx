summary: 'DeepSeek is the better performing LLM than OpenAI and it is Open Source'

Traning a LLM takes a lot of computing power. NVIDIA provides taht but since the US has put a limit on these chips that are being sold to China. So now China does not have the NVIDIA chip resources the US has. Here is the thing: they just created a better large language model training that requires less computing power and bites OpenAI in the ass, in several benchmarks.

### Open source
But the real middle finger is the decision to just open source everything. This puts a lot of pressure on the value proposition of the OpenAI models. Bad for OpenAI maybe. Splendid for us! We can freely use a better LLM than OpenAI and even build our own.
