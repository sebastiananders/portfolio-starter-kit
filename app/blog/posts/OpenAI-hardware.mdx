Casually browsing Reddit made me realize: the Internet is about to implode. All because of AI taking over the content. The very reason we are using Reddit, Instagram, etc

AI is also being trained on this very content. This basically is cannibalism, or as a Reddit user put it more eloquently: incest. Using that analogy the heterogeneous content will vanish and the internet will crumble and platforms will fall. But not without a bang! I am forecasting a time where we (the humans using the internet) get in serious trouble because of this. Fake content, propaganda, phishing, scams and a lot more things that will make our visit to the internet unbearable.

One could argue that the internet was never meant to be a consumption machinery for humans. That the internet is a network of machines talking to each other. We like to think about the machine as the man in the middle to enable us to communicate. But in reality, we humans are the man in the middle. Now that we are forced to rethink our perspective on the medium we better prepare for a different reality. 

Letâ€™s take a look at what visions the smarter and more ambitious people of our time have for us. Have you heard of OpenAI acquiring the majority of Jony Ives hardware company? "OpenAI is buying iPhone designer Jony Ive's AI devices startup for $6.4 billion". Cool. But, wait! Jony Ive has a device startup? In time when everyone is focusing on AI software? And why does OpenAI care so much about hardware? (6.4 billion Dollar is very much!)

Here is the website announcing IO https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/
It has some serious Humane AI Pin vibes. Only better, I hope.

"What it means to use technology can change in a profound way. I hope we can bring some of the delight, wonder and creative spirit that I first felt using an Apple Computer 30 years ago."

Two visionary people working together since 2 years and building a product (or products?). I get super excited seeing that. The video is super inspiring. As for me as a tech savvy person and a designer by heart, I am looking forward to follow this journey. I think we are witnessing the next evolutionary step of technology. The internet is the foundation that makes this kind of products possible. Let's move on.
