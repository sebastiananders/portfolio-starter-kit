# Situation

I built my own blog.* And not only writing posts takes effort, but to maintain the stack and keeping the CI/CD pipeline healthy means some overhead tax, that I do not have the time for.

I went deep into it — and built something real. With [V0](https://v0.dev), I created a comprehensive web app in just **three days**. We're talking full user auth, backend, CMS — the whole thing. Normally, that would have taken me at least **three months** to build from scratch. But with the current version (v74), the app does *everything* I throw at it. I'm honestly mind-blown.

### Context

I wanted to support local shops in my town — help them feel more represented. Give them a voice against giants like Amazon and Karstadt. I wanted them to connect, organize, and most importantly: I wanted people to easily shop around town with *one* single app.

### The Build

I started with a simple card UI that shows businesses producing, manufacturing, and distributing locally. Users could apply some filters. Later, I added category search and a favorite-button feature.

When researching local shops, I actually walked through town and took photos of storefronts I wanted to include. That part was fun, but honestly, it took way too long. There are so many shops — I needed a faster way to get things live.

So I added a **CMS** I can use while out and about, to quickly add shops on the go. Everything I wanted to build was fast and intuitive with V0. It didn't feel like "coding" — more like composing a vibe.

### Next Steps

I'm now thinking about user roles. Eventually, I want shop owners to be able to edit or add their own data. For now, it's fine that I'm the only one managing content. But to scale — and maybe even sell this one day — I'll need proper **user authentication and roles**.
