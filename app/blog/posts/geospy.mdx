With **GeoSpy AI** you are able to find the exact location from only one indoor photograph, without using the exif metadata. It seems that it only needs some windows to determine the neighboorhood. 

Not going into detail from the technical perspective. I’d rather discuss the implications. Let’s assume for a moment this works flawlessly and is actually able to do what it promises.

### Pro
Crime investigation has a long record in using single photographs to find an exact location. There is ton of material online, where crimes are being committed in front of a camera. Highly trained people are able to identify tiles in kitchens, pattern on wallpapers or a specific wood texture on the floor. Perfect use case for AI. Same with location data, when some details are visible from the windows. Finding people online never was easier. But it also has a downside..

### Contra
Using the internet to perform a dance or sing to a song is cool. You can share your dance and see others dancing. My kids do that all the time. (not on f*** Snapchat though). Here is the thing: People don’t care about that cringe AI shit. They care about what the internet can do for them. I care about my kids. So I tell them: people can find out where you live more easier than ever. This is a nightmare. Burglars and stalkers have a new tool at hand. 

**addendum**
There are several other ways to find the exact location of people in videos and photographs. In videos using patterns of voltage fluctuation in a housing block or sound waves pattern from distant large landmarks. Combining these technologies makes it even more easier to find you.
