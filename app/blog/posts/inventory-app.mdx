# Inventory App  

While waiting for the hiring team to move forward in the process, I wanted to design and build something. Looking at my calendar, I realized I had an entire day free from responsibilities—perfect timing.  

Right now, I’m working at a desk in the film workspace of a good friend. He has a massive storage area filled with everything he might need for his film projects. Recently, he reorganized one of his spaces using gray containers to store smaller items. That got me thinking: what if I built an app in just 8 hours to help him keep track of everything?  

## The Problem  
He has 40 containers, each filled with multiple small items. From the outside, you can’t see what’s inside—you either have to read the labels or physically open each container. I want to digitize that process.

## My Approach  
The idea is to create a digital abstraction of the storage space, where each container is visually represented and clickable. Inside each container view, you can see the items, their quantities, and perform CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The app would maintain a database to keep the inventory up to date.  

## Choosing the Right Tool  
I started by asking ChatGPT for recommendations on the best AI-powered app builder. Since I’ve already tested V0, Replit, and Lovable, I wanted to find the best fit for this type of project. ChatGPT provided suggestions, and I immediately started building with ChatGPT itself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I was blown away by how quickly and accurately it understood my prompts and transformed them into working code. The live preview and the ability to share the staging environment for testing on different devices made the process incredibly smooth.  

## The Result  
In just two hours, I built a functional tool that:  
✅ Fetch and stores data from a Firebase database
✅ Displays the container layout  
✅ Shows the contents of each container  
✅ Supports CRUD actions for items  
✅ Sends notifications when inventory changes

All of this in just a few hours. Now it's lunch time \o/
