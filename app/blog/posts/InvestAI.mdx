### EU launches InvestAI initiative to mobilise €200 billion of investment in artificial intelligence

Yesterday, Ursula von der Leyen announced:

> “AI will improve our healthcare, spur our research and innovation and boost our competitiveness. We want AI to be a force for good and for growth. We are doing this through our own European approach – based on openness, cooperation and excellent talent.(…)”

**What the EU aims to achieve with €200 billion:**
	* 	Building AI Factories and GigaFactories
	* 	Establishing 12 cutting-edge AI hubs powered by EuroHPC supercomputers
	* 	Democratizing AI computing power (think CERN, but for AI)
	* 	Providing world-class infrastructure accessible to startups and scientists
	* 	Focusing on trustworthy AI, with a strong emphasis on the industrial sector and mission-critical applications

### Thoughts
Good idea. Kind of late but better than never. Regulation first, invest later is a bold strategy, Cotton. [Lets See If It Pays Off For Em](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HVejEB5uVk)

Let’s rethink for a moment where innovation comes from. If I remember correctly from the books and articles I’ve read over the years, several factors need to come together to drive true innovation.

We are definitely in the steam engine moment of AI. Remember: The steam engine’s success underscores the importance of timing in innovation. Its invention met the growing energy demands of industries, facilitating advancements that might not have been possible in an earlier era.

Real innovation is not fueled by money. It is fueled by smart people with a common vision, working together and hitting just the right time with something the world needs.

Regulations and bureaucracy slow innovation down.
