# Token Agent
When it comes to automation we tend to think about the technical possiblities, rather than the actual use cases. It’s a natural habit, since most people thinking about that kind of stuff are tech savyy people. 

Here is my approach to a use case focused agent building:

### The issue
I have been building a manual process pipeline. It basically does: Figma token export, upload to Github repo, on a specific branch. Nothing else. But it mostly is done by manual activators. (Me doing stuff)
### What I gonna do
Here is my plan. I want this to be automated. When I change a variable in our design system I want the agent to acknowledge the changes and create a new token for that change. This tokens then gets checked if everything is fine and then will be uploaded to a specific branch on Github. To conclude this automation I’d like to have the agent sending a message on to the team on Slack, with this particular update.

### What’s next
Now I dont have much experience in building such agents but how hard can it be? 
ChatGPT put out a script that promises to do just that.
It looks like this:

Let’s see what the test shows. First I need to gather all the API access token.
