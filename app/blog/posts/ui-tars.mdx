ByteDance (you know: TikTok) has forked VSCode and built their own Cursor. They have named it **UI-Tars.**  ¯ \ _ (ツ)_/¯ 

They are giving away free Sonet-3.5, but it also works with on-device AI coding LLMs on llama.cpp. The agentic mode is very similar to what we get from Cursor, Windsurf, and Co.

UI-TARS is a VLM based on Qwen with added perception, reasoning, grounding, and memory. You can also make it RTFM and work with your GUI based on documentation and manuals.

### Thoughts
What can go wrong if you send your project through Chinas government pipeline? I don’t see nothing wrong with it. (Try building a Tianmen Square Massacre app with UI-Tars)
